A realistic video of a person standing and speaking directly to the camera like a confident live streamer. The person maintains an upright posture and delivers an energetic promotional speech. The person is holding a pack of Fisherman’s Friend Sugar-Free Lozenges in the left hand from the beginning of the video. While speaking, the left hand holds the product and occasionally raises it slightly and angles it toward the camera to clearly present it. The right hand performs dynamic and rhythmic gestures that complement the speech. Both hands are clearly visible, independent, and unobstructed at all times. Facial expressions are expressive and emotionally engaging, with natural smiles, subtle head nods, and confident eye contact with the camera. The original background from the image remains unchanged. The camera remains steady, capturing sharp, clear movements and a focused, engaging presence.@@img/img/nick/mrko.jpg@@img/img/nick/fishermanpromo.mp3
