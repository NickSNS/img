A realistic video of a person standing upright and facing the camera. In the first frame, the person is already holding a pack of Fisherman’s Friend Sugar-Free Lozenges in the left hand and making direct eye contact with the camera like a confident live streamer. Throughout the video, the person delivers an energetic promotional speech. While speaking, the left hand continues to hold the product and occasionally raises it slightly and angles it toward the camera to clearly present it. The right hand performs dynamic and rhythmic gestures that complement the speech. Both hands are clearly visible, independent, and unobstructed at all times. Facial expressions are expressive and emotionally engaging, with natural smiles, subtle head nods, and confident eye contact.The original background from the image remains unchanged. The camera remains steady, capturing sharp, clear movements and a focused, engaging presence.@@img/img/nick/newMrKowithfisherman.png@@img/img/nick/shorter.mp3
